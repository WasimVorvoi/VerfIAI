Winning project for SBHack

VerfIAI is a Python-based GUI tool designed to verify the accuracy of YouTube content using artificial intelligence. When a user inputs a YouTube video link, the application downloads the video and extracts its audio. The audio is then transcribed into text using speech-to-text technology. This transcription is passed to a reliable AI system that checks each claim against trusted sources on the internet. Finally, VerfIAI presents the user with a clear verdict on whether the videoâ€™s content is true, partially true, or false.
